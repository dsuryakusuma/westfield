> *"We think the best experience comes from working with a real, live person. That’s why we only offer our products through trained, knowledgeable agents. Westfield is represented by some of the best independent agencies in the business. We take great care and consideration in choosing our agency force to make sure they’re a good fit for both Westfield and our customers. Selected for their strength, responsiveness and customer focus, we work hard to connect with agencies that offer both experience and expertise. Westfield agencies are selected for their proven commitment to customers and alignment with Westfield’s promise to provide solutions."*

Westfield recognizes **three tiers** of its agencies in terms of expertise and commitment to success and values.

- [Trilogy](https://www.westfieldinsurance.com/Westfield%20Corporate%20Site%20Assets/Documents/2019-20_Trilogy%20Agencies.pdf)
- [Horizon](https://www.westfieldinsurance.com/Westfield%20Corporate%20Site%20Assets/Documents/2019-20_Horizon%20Agencies.pdf)
- [Rise](https://www.westfieldinsurance.com/Westfield%20Corporate%20Site%20Assets/Documents/2019-20_Rise%20Agencies.pdf)


#### Complexity, Simplified:

> *"When you have too many other things to worry about while managing your business, you don’t have time to deal with complex insurance plans. Instead, Westfield agents keep up with you. We take the complex and make it simple for you to understand quickly and efficiently, giving you back more time in your day."*

#### Benefits of working with an independent insurance agent:

- Expertise in your industry
- Extensive experience working with small busiunesses
- Flexibility and access to multitudes of products and coverages 
- Proven results and quality protection


## Web .pdf scraping

From Westfield's [public website](https://www.westfieldinsurance.com/about-us/independent-agency-partners), we don't have numbers for sales or size of these agencies; however, we can still do a quick classification. 

```{r}
# top 10%
trilogy.raw <- pdf_text(pdf = "https://www.westfieldinsurance.com/Westfield%20Corporate%20Site%20Assets/Documents/2019-20_Trilogy%20Agencies.pdf")

qkable <- function(x, height="360px") {
  x %>% kable(format = "html") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "responsive", "striped", "hover", "bordered"), font_size = 11, position = "center") %>% scroll_box(width="100%", height= height, fixed_thead =  list(enabled = TRUE, background = "lightgrey") ) 
}
```

Let's make a function to start off the data cleaning. 


```{r}

getIA <- function(raw_data, keyword) {
  # raw.data : read out of pdf_text function; should be a list of arrays (of text)
  # keyword : text of the IA tier by which we want to separate (i.e. "Trilogy")
  tmp <- raw_data %>% strsplit("\\n") # split by line breaks
  n.pages <- length(raw_data) # number of pages in the pdf
  
  scrape <- tibble(data = grep( paste0("  ", keyword), tmp[[1]], value = TRUE) ) # keep only data columns of spreadsheet
  
  # combine the pages of the pdf
  if (n.pages >= 2) {
    for (pg in 2:n.pages) {
      # print(pg) # debug
      scrape <- rbind(scrape, tibble( 
                                   data = grep( paste0("  ", keyword), tmp[[pg]], 
                                                      value = TRUE) ) )  # add new pages' columns
  } }
  # print(scrape) # debugging
  
  # clean tab delimited
  # while ( grep("  ", scrape) ) { #
  #   scrape <- gsub( pattern = "$", replace = " ", x = scrape)
  # }
  
  
  # scrape <-  mutate(scrape, 
  #                   modified = gsubgsub("  ", "#", scrape) )
  # 
  return(tibble(scrape))
}
```

rise.raw <- pdf_text(pdf = "https://www.westfieldinsurance.com/Westfield%20Corporate%20Site%20Assets/Documents/2019-20_Rise%20Agencies.pdf")
rise <- getIA(raw_data = rise.raw, keyword = "Rise") # clean in excel for interest of time (I should get sleep before the interview)
```


```{r, include = FALSE}
